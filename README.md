# My Vim Config

I've mostly put this 'out there' for my own use, so that I can quickly bring up my entire preferred
vim setup anywhere `curl` and `git` are present. I'm sharing it publicly though so others can use
it freely as a resource however they please.

# Two color schemes depending on environment

Some environments I work in do not yet support `termguicolors`, so I've configured my .vimrc to
auto-adjust to such environments and still provide a color scheme that I don't mind working in
(though I'm still in the process of selecting my favorite alternate color scheme).
